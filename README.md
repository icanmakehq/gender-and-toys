Gender and Toys
====================
A survey about children and engineering toys and if and where there are differences in which toys children want to play with.
--------------------

Introduction
====================

As we've been making I Can Make we keep being asked the same question "Will girls like it?". Whenever we show what we're doing to girls young and old we get the same responses "We love it" or "We wish this was around when we were kids". The gendering of toys seems to be on the increase, rather than the decrease and yet when you speak to girls and boys they are often just as keen to do the same thing.

We want I Can Make to be a degendered product, as much fun for boys as it is for girls and as much fun for girls as it is for boys. We're keen to do our bit also for STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) and we want to make sure that no one gender enjoys our educational materials more than others.

We decided it was time to do some research, and this is the beginning of it. We're aiming to send out our survey to children young and old, girls and boys, in September 2014, just as all the schools go back. We'll analyse the data from December 2014 and present our findings just in time for London Toy Fair in January 2015.

We'd love to get your help, and we'll explain how you can help below.

Why are we doing this?
====================

Over the past few years toys have seemed to become more gendered. Even previously ungendered things such as Kinder Eggs are now available in "blue with Hot Wheels for boys" and "pink with Barbie for girls" varieties.

Wonderful campaigns such as <a href="http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/">Let Toys be Toys</a> are pointing out the problem to big brands, retailers are changing and we know of some within the manufacturing side who are just as frustrated. There are wonderful new ungendered products such as <a href="http://littlebits.cc/new_home">Little Bits</a>, <a href="http://makie.me/">MakieLab</a>, <a href="http://www.techwillsaveus.com/">Technology Will Save Us</a> and <a href="http://tocaboca.com/">Toca Boca</a> and there are products such as <a href="http://www.goldieblox.com/">Goldieblox</a> who are making engineering toys for girls, breaking the norm.

The problem we're finding is many people still seem to think the stereotypes are true. In  many meetings we've had over the last six months we've heard many times from some grown ups that "Girls won't want to make airplanes, trains, cars, boats and buildings", when we speak to girls we hear the opposite. 

We want to research this, we need to research this and with your help we're going to research this. We don't want to distance girls from our products, but we also don't want to make them feel different. We want to use the data from this survey to help inform the design of our products and also in situations where we're having a difficult discussion with someone about packaging colour and that "it's just a thing for boys". 

To quote C.P. Scott, editor and owner of The Guardian, "Comment is free, facts are sacred". We'd like the facts to back up our argument. 

What are we doing?
====================

We're doing a piece of open research. What do we mean by this? We mean that we don't know all the questions or the answers. We're going to crowdsource the questionnaire with your help. We're going to do that in the open so that anyone has a chance to comment and make suggestions. We're then going to ask for your help again to send the questionnaire to girls and boys, young and old. We're then going to analyse the data but we're also going to make the anonymised data available to anyone to analyse too. 

There are three phases: 

* July - August 2014: Crowdsourcing the questionaire
* September - November 2014: Distributing the questionaire far and wide
* December 2014 - January 2015: Analysing the data and publishing our results

We aim to publish our results on the week of the London Toy Fair 2015.

What can you do to help?
====================

Many things. If you'd like to get involved in the questionaire you can do it in one of two ways:

* If you're feeling technical, you can follow the source code repository on GitHub. Please feel free to fork the repository and send us pull requests for your suggestions.
* If you don't understand any of the words in the previous sentence, please don't worry or give up, you can also send us suggestions by email.
* Follow us on Twitter or on our blog. We'll post regularly about what we're doing and how you can get involved.

Thank you.
