Kids and Engineering Toys
====================

A survey about children and engineering toys and the gender bias of the toy industry.

As we've been making I Can Make we keep being asked the same question "Will girls like it?". Whenever we show what we're doing to girls young and old we get the same responses "We love it" or "We wish this was around when we were kids". The gendering of toys seems to be on the increase, rather than the decrease and yet when you speak to girls and boys they are often just as keen to do the same thing.

We decided it was time to do some research, and this is the beginning of it. We're aiming to send out our survey to children young and old, girls and boys, in September 2014, just as all the schools go back. We'll analyse the data from December 2014 and present our findings just in time for London Toy Fair in January 2015.
